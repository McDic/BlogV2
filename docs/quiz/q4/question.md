---

This is a mobile game called ["산수의 달인"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ansangha.drcomputer&hl=ko),
where you have to generate math formula using addition($+$), subtraction($-$), multiply($\times$), or division($\div$)
with given $4$ numbers.

    For example, if you make $9 \times (3 + 2)$, then you can clear $45$ on this picture.

Now let's approach this game in inversed direction.
Can you give $4$ numbers that can generate $10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90$?
There can be duplicated numbers.
For example, $6, 7, 4, 1$ can generate followings;

- $10 = 6+4$
- $20 = 4 \times (6-1)$
- $30 = 6 \times (4+1)$
- $40 = 6 \times (7-1) + 4$
- $60 = 6 \times (7+4-1)$
- $70 = 7 \times (6+4)$
- $80 = (7+1) \times (6+4)$

But not $50, 90$.
