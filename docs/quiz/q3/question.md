title: QUIZ 3. Cool Curves
---

Let's say if function $f(x)$ in domain $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies all following conditions, then let's call $f$ as *"cool curve"*.

- $f$ is a continuous function, and $f(x)$ exists for all real number $x$.
- $f'$ exists and $f'(x) \ge 0$ for all real number $x$. In other words, $f$ is non-decreasing.
- $f''$ exists and $f''(x) \le 0$ for all real number $x$. In other words, derivative of $f$ is non-increasing.

You are going to draw $n$ cool functions in $2$-dimensional plane.
How many different areas can you create with $n$ cool functions?
For example, if $n = 2$, then you can create up to $5$ areas as drawn below.

!!! formula

    - The red line is drawn by $f(x) = x-5$.
    - The blue line is drawn by $f(x) = -e^{-x}$.

    Both functions are cool curves, satisfying all conditions above.
