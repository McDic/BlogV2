title: QUIZ 3. Cool Quadratics
---

Let's say if function $f(x)$ in domain $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfies all following conditions, then let's call $f$ as *"cool quadratic"*.

- $f(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial.
- $f''(x) \le 0$.

In other words, $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and $a < 0$.

You are going to draw $n$ cool quadratics in $2$-dimensional plane.
How many different areas can you create with $n$ cool quadratics?
For example, if $n = 2$, then you can create up to $5$ areas as drawn below.

!!! formula

    - The red line is drawn by $f(x) = -x^2 + 10$.
    - The blue line is drawn by $f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 7$.

    Both functions are cool quadratics, satisfying all conditions above.
