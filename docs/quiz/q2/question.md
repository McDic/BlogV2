---

Suppose you have an infinitely large plane.
If you draw $3$ lines here, then the maximum amount of area you can create is $7$, as drawn below.

    The white lines are $3$ lines you draw on the plane, and black areas are separated parts of the plane.
    There is no way to separate more than $7$ areas with $3$ lines.

Now you have an infinitely large $3$-dimensional cube.
How many areas you can separate with $4$ infinitely large planes?
Maximize it, and explain why.
