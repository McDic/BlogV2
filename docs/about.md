## Algorithmic Problem Solving

I am not actively doing algorithmic problem-solving nor problem-setting anymore.

### Contests

Followings are some my achievements from major contests.

- KOI 2014 Final, Bronze Medal (High school division)

- [Google Code Jam and Kick Start](https://zibada.guru/gcj/profile/McDic) (Since Google discontinued their coding competitions, this link will send you to an unofficial archive)

### Problemsetting

I made many algorithm(CS stuff) problems for many contests and hiring tests.
Some problem data are unavailable due to legal and copyright issues, but here are my public problems in case you are interested.
