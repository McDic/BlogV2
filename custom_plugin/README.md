# `mkdocs-material-mcdic`

This python package is used for my custom plugin on [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/dev-guide/plugins/) to customize some of my blog behaviours.
Since this plugin is solely developed for this blog, I included the whole sourcecode in my blog repository.
[Editable install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/) would be enough to use this plugin to deploy the blog.
